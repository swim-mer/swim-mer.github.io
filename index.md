#### My first ever Swift App

This week I opened Xcode and created my first Swift app for macOS. It runs! Center image is an image capture from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/).

Now to make this app do something with some user input. I added a text input, a text box, and a button. The text box shows the text the user puts into the text input. The button currently does nothing.

I made this recording after sun down, no hands on work was done to make this app compatible with dark mode. Pretty cool!
