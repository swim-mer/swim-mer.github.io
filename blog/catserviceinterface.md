### My first ever Swift App
#### May 21 2023

This week I opened Xcode and created my first macOS app written with Swift. It runs! Center image is an image capture from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/).

Now to make this app do something with some user input. I added a text input, a text box, and a button. The text box shows the text the user puts into the text input. The button currently does nothing.

I made this recording after sun down. No hands on work was done to make this app compatible with dark mode. Pretty cool!

This week I found an API to use for endpoint querying. It's called [Cat as a Service](https://cataas.com/).

The user enters characters into the text box, clicks the button, and the last character of the input is removed. Also, the image changes to a random cat image made via HTTP GET request from CaaS. The two are currently unrelated.
