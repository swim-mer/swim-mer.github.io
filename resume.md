## About

My core skills are leading projects, learning new skills, and problem solving. I'm also good at communicating technical topics with the less technically inclined. Great at low level details, math, physics, and programming. In my spare time I enjoy improving my skills and learning new things.--></html>

May 2021–Feb 2022
* Removed the need for manual integration of more than 10 third party packages by writing CMake, Bazel, and Bash scripts to automate builds, saving hours of manual build configuration during early stages of package’s development
* Automated line coverage tracking using EC2 image build rules that monitored and enforced line coverage as development velocity and bug quantity increased, decreasing the number of customer error reports made
* Made logic more modular and facilitated the easier, more precise resolution of bugs for future additions to the codebase, preventing accumulation of tech debt and saving hundreds of future engineer hours
* Wrote unit tests using C/C++ 20 and Google’s GTest Framework, increasing total coverage by over 30% for new and existing code with no previous line coverage, preventing major runtime errors before they reached customers
* Designed, documented, and pitched a tool to check for third party package release updates using GitHub metadata, influencing the team to automate a costly manual process

#### Wrote full stack software for Nitrium, a web-based firmware deployment application
<a href="https://codeigniter.com/"><img class="logo" alt="CodeIgniter Logo" src="/assets/images/codeigniter.png"/></a>
<a href="https://vuejs.org/"><img class="logo" alt="Vuejs Logo" src="/assets/images/vue-logo.png"/></a>
<a href="https://www.python.org/"><img class="logo" alt="Python Logo" src="/assets/images/python-logo-only.png"/></a>
* Added full stack features and fixed bugs in PHP’s CodeIgniter and Javascript’s Vue.js during early development of the application, laying the foundation for a company direction change from consulting-focused to product-based
* Migrated the backend’s used PHP framework REST API endpoints from CodeIgniter 2 to CodeIgniter 4 to stay current with web security standards, improving application security and removing several security holes
* Wrote Python scripts to test against backend API endpoints during migration cutting migration time by weeks

<a href="https://www.docker.com/"><img class="logo" alt="Docker logo" src="/assets/images/docker-logo.png"/></a>

Mar 2020–Nov 2020 
* Gathered requirements and developed, tested, and deployed an automated testing framework in Python 3 to automate manual testing of ProcessMaker’s GUI, broaden testing scope, and reduce costs and time spent on manual processes
* Tweaked Python 3 module implementation to enable the dynamic creation of logs in production mode for more efficient and effective troubleshooting, saving weeks spent tracking down the source of bugs
* Worked with the client to create a set of personalized automated test cases that caught known and unknown bugs in test deployment before moving to production, directly improving ProcessMaker’s relationship with the client
* Led and mentored a team of QA devs through building and developing for the automated testing framework to empower them to automate their own processes, enabling them to work on more meaningful projects
