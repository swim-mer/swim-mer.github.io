The Login page connects the user to the MySQL database. It also displays the time zone of the user's computer. If the computer's language is set to French, the app will display in French.

The Customers page displays all the customers in the database. Users can add, edit, or delete customers. If a customer is deleted, so are their associated appointments.

The Appointments page displays all appointments scheduled for this week by default. A radio button allows the user to switch between this week and this month. There are also three reports available for users to view.
