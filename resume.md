#### Geisel Software, Inc. 							      
May 2021–Feb 2022
* Removed manual integration of more than 10 third party packages by writing CMake, Bazel, and Bash scripts to automate builds, saving hours of manual build configuration during early stages of package’s development
* Automated line coverage tracking using EC2 image build rules that monitored and enforced line coverage as development velocity and bug quantity increased, decreasing the number of customer error reports made
* Made logic more modular and facilitated the easier, more precise resolution of bugs for future additions to the codebase, preventing accumulation of tech debt and saving hundreds of future engineer hours
* Wrote unit tests using C/C++ 20 and Google’s GTest Framework, increasing total coverage by over 30% for new and existing code with no previous line coverage, preventing major runtime errors before they reached customers
* Designed and pitched a design document for a tool to check of third party package release updates using GitHub metadata after writing and pitching it to seniors, influencing the team to automate a costly manual process

#### Wrote full stack software for Nitrium, Firmware deployment application
<a href="https://codeigniter.com/"><img class="logo" alt="CodeIgniter Logo" src="/assets/images/codeigniter.png"/></a>
<a href="https://vuejs.org/"><img class="logo" alt="Vuejs Logo" src="/assets/images/vue-logo.png"/></a>
<a href="https://www.python.org/"><img class="logo" alt="Python Logo" src="/assets/images/python-logo-only.png"/></a>
* Added features and fixed bugs across entire stack, in PHP’s CodeIgniter and Javascript’s Vue.js, laying the foundation for company direction change from consulting-focused to product-based
* Migrated the backend’s used PHP framework REST API endpoints from CodeIgniter 2 to CodeIgniter 4 to stay current with web security standards, improving application security and removing several security holes
* Wrote Python scripts to test against backend API endpoints during migration cutting migration time by weeks

### Software Engineer  					      			             	     
#### Designed and developed Trogdor, a framework for automatically testing ProcessMaker’s UI
<a href="https://www.python.org/"><img class="logo" alt="Python Logo" src="/assets/images/python-logo-only.png"/></a>
<a href="https://www.docker.com/"><img class="logo" alt="Docker logo" src="/assets/images/docker-logo.png"/></a>
#### ProcessMaker, Inc.
Mar 2020–Nov 2020 
* Designed/Architected and built/developed an automated testing framework from scratch to be run inside a Docker container in order to streamline processes implementing workflows through the use of JSON APIs for BPMN SaaS, reducing the overall cost of manual labor and finding bugs that manual testers missed
* Changed behavior of official Python 3 source code for integration with the framework I wrote to add persistence to the unittest module, enabling the dynamic creation of logs in production mode
* Worked directly with the client to create a set of personalized automated test cases that caught known and unknown bugs in test deployment before moving to production, improving ProcessMaker’s relationship with the client
* Led a team of QA devs through building and implementing the automated testing framework to spread deeper understanding of the product and empower manual testers to automate their own processes
* Mentored other team members for collaboration and mutual growth, enforced code standards such as using a linter and using version control to prevent future bottlenecks and improve overall efficiency in team progress
