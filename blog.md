### My first ever Swift App
#### May 28 2023

This week I found an API to use for endpoint querying. It's called [Cat as a Service](https://cataas.com/).

I spent the week setting up HTTP GET requests in Swift and managing the View. I learned about [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession), managing [State](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state) variables in SwiftUI, converting bytes to [NSImage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage) data types, and the concept of an [Optional](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional) and how to unwrap it. I'm liking Swift! 

Now the user enters characters into the text box, clicks the button, and the last character of the input is removed. Also, the image changes to a random cat image made via HTTP GET request from CaaS. The two are currently unrelated.
